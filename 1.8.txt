Ans 1.8:

(define (cbrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (cbrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 x)))

A guess is improved by :

(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x (square y)) (* 2 y)) 3)


(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (cube guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (cube x) (* x x x))

Finally, we need a way to get started. For instance, we can always guess that the cube root of any number is 1:23

(define (cbrt x)
  (cbrt-iter 1.0 x))
