Ans 1.7:

 The good-enough? test used in computing square roots will not be very effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers. Also, in real computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited precision. This makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. 

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))


Ex.
large number :
 x=25;
 guess=4.9

small number :
 x=0.000025
 guess=0.0049

This guess for x=25 is not acceptable as the difference b/w square of guess=4.9 and 25 is greater then the set threshold. But guess=0.0049 is acceptable for x=0.000025 as the difference b/w square of guess and x is less the 0.001

 An alternative strategy for implementing good-enough? is to watch how guess changes from one iteration to the next and to stop when the change is a very small fraction of the guess.

(define (good-enough? guess )
  (<(/ (improve guess x) guess) 0.00001)

now this good-enough? function will work good for both large and small number.
